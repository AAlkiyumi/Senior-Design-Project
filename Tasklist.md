2. **Redesign the existing scraper to allow users to target reviews of a specific product on a website**, instead of scraping the entire website.
3. **Develop an executable (.exe)** that allows users to easily launch the UI and automatically run all required dependencies for the scraper.
4. **Test and validate the functionality and usability** of both interfaces to ensure they meet specified requirements and perform as intended.
5. **Document the entire project development process**, including detailed steps for setting up, configuring, and running the application. Additionally, create comprehensive user guides for both business users and developers, outlining how to interact with the UI, manage scraping tasks, and monitor website changes.

## Task List:
1. **Evaluate the existing user interface for the web scraper. Document findings.** Note what works and what doesn't. Gather any prior design restrictions and evaluate them to see if they are still applicable.
2. **Design a maintainable user interface following best practices. Document design choices.** Study UI best practices and learn what common pitfalls to avoid.
3. **Research frontend frameworks and make an informed selection for the project. Document rationalization for selection.** Review user testimony for popular frameworks such as React, Svelte, Tailwind CSS, etc. Discuss with team the pros and cons of each and see which would be best for integrating with the rest of the tech stack.
4. **Develop the user interface in the selected frontend framework. Document development process and how maintenance should be performed in order to maintain selected design patterns.** Incrementally implement the features of the user interface. Collaborate on documentation for how the frontend will communicate with the backend.
5. **Gather user feedback on the frontend user experience. Apply the feedback if reasonable and possible.** Seek out possible test users to gather feedback on how the UI is presented, if the operation of the tool makes sense, etc. Apply any recommendations if they are applicable, and update documentation as needed.
6. **Test user interface against multiple different aspect ratios to ensure it is operable and presentable on many different screens. Document any findings during this process.** Ensure that the UI works on several common display sizes and orientations.
